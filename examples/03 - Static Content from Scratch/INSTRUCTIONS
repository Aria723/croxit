1 - run 'nme update Test.nmml iphone'
2 - open the bin/iphone/Test3.xcodeproj in xcode
3 - click and drag the 'www' folder to your project tab in xcode
	A dialogue will appear
4 - Select Reference type as "Relative to Project", and check "Create folder References" (so you are able to edit the index.html sources directly)
5 - save the project
6 - copy bin/iphone/Test3.xcodeproj to your template folder

-- Why is this necessary?
 
	1) we don't want to impose a needed 'www' location for this to work
	2) The NME build tool doesn't allow custom templates to be generated with the project name
